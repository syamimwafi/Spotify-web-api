        Spotify began its journey in the year 2006, which was the start of Spotify, and since then, it has been serving a platter of podcasts, videos, and music to its customers. Founded by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and music service provider. Headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, Spotify brings a wide selection consisting of more than 70 million songs from an array of diverse record labels and media companies. As the company brings digital, copyright-protected podcasts and musical content to its users, it helps them enjoy the basic features and access limited contents that are distinguished for the advertisements in them as freemium. However, Spotify also brings affordable subscriptions for the users, which helps them access its treasure trove of content, add-free.

        The core business of the company lies in music or audio streaming. Although Spotify was founded in 2006, it was launched 2 years later in the year 2008. One of the main reasons for the commercial success of the Spotify business is that it provides a good list of search variables where the users can type the song, artist, album, or genre on the search bar and then hit go, THAT'S IT. Spotify enjoys a huge cheering section of about 381 million active users (monthly), of which 172 million are premium users as of September 2021.

        A user can use Spotify in two modes i.e, online and offline. For offline mode, a premium membership is needed with which you get access to download from Spotify's collection of 13 million+ songs. However, for the online mode, the internet connection is a prerequisite and premium membership is not needed. Spotify App is available both for mobile and desktop, so you can just sign in to spotify.com and start listening if you don't want to go with the app.

            Spotify offers four different types of Premium subscriptions, and some of them are really great deals. First, there is the Spotify Premium Individual subscription, which is RM45.00/month. This allows access to all the Premium features such as no ad interruptions, on-demand playback, and downloading tracks for offline listening. If youâ€™re a full-time student at a university or college, you should be eligible for the Premium Student subscription, which is RM24.90/month. Not only does this afford you all the same features of Spotify Premium.

            If you want to share a Premium account with your live-in partner, you can get Premium Duo. It costs RM21.90/month and both you and your partner will have your own separate accounts with all the same functionality of an individual account.

            Spotify Premium Family is very similar to Premium Duo, as all members must live at the same address. Premium Family, though, can support up to six separate accounts, and costs $14.99/month. Parents can choose to block explicit music for specific members, and children can use their Premium Family account on the Spotify Kids app.

            All of these subscription options are very cool, but ultimately, when it comes down to it, free is free. If the absence of needing to fork over a portion of your paycheck every month is enough motivation to deal with the ads, lack of features, and inconvenience of Free Spotify, then Free Spotify is going to be the option for you.
